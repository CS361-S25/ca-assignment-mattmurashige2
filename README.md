1. This cellular automaton demonstrates a system that is a modification of Conway's game of life. It utilizes a toroidal structure to consider the neighbors of a cell, and changes a cell depending on the survival status of its neighbors. Instead of following the binary alive/dead structure that Conway's game of life follows, it uses continuous values to allow cells to fade in and out depending on whether their conditions are conducive to survival or not. If they have a favorable number of thriving cells in their vicinity (i.e., have a value of 0.8 or greater), they will also thrive. Otherwise, they will begin to decay. Extremely healthy cells and near-dead cells (> 0.95 and < 0.05 respectively) are randomly 'reincarnated' as a new cell of random survival status.
